# Requirements Document

## Introduction

이 문서는 FastUI와 Plotly를 통합한 RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation)와 MCP(Model Context Protocol) 대화형 AI 스튜디오의 요구사항을 정의합니다. 이 스튜디오는 uv로 패키지를 관리하고, Typer를 사용한 CLI 인터페이스(`uv run ais --help`, `uv run ais run`)를 통해 FastUI 기반 웹 인터페이스를 제공합니다. 모든 UI 객체와 리소스는 FastUI에서 관리하며, 그래픽과 사용자 상호작용을 위해 Plotly를 사용합니다. 시스템은 AI 개발자, AI 평가자, AI 사용자의 세 가지 사용자 역할에 맞춘 차별화된 인터페이스를 제공합니다.

3. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL display comparative analysis including response quality, speed, and cost using FastUI tables and comparison cards
4. WHEN model performance is analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide interactive Plotly visualizations for model comparison metrics embedded within FastUI dashboard layouts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI developer, I want to securely store OpenAI API keys with encryption, so that I can safely manage authentication credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer enters an API key THEN the system SHALL encrypt the key before storage
2. WHEN the system needs to use an API key THEN the system SHALL decrypt it securely without exposing the plain text
3. WHEN API keys are managed THEN the system SHALL provide a secure FastUI form interface for adding, updating, and removing keys with proper input validation
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate stored API keys and notify of any issues through FastUI notification components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an AI evaluator, I want simple and clear infographics and chat interface for final answers, so that I can assess query response quality without overwhelming technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query is processed THEN the system SHALL display a clean, simplified view focusing on the final answer quality using FastUI cards and clean typography
2. WHEN evaluation metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear Plotly infographics embedded in FastUI components showing response accuracy, relevance, and completeness
3. WHEN comparing responses THEN the system SHALL offer side-by-side comparison views with quality indicators using FastUI grid layouts and comparison components
4. WHEN using the chat interface THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive conversation flow without technical complexity through FastUI chat components and message layouts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an AI user, I want a simple prompt interface for input and results, so that I can easily interact with the AI system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the system THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, minimal prompt interface using FastUI input components and simple layouts
2. WHEN a user enters a query THEN the system SHALL process it and return results without exposing technical details
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL present them in a user-friendly format using FastUI text components and clean card layouts
4. WHEN the user needs help THEN the system SHALL provide simple guidance without technical jargon through FastUI help components and tooltips

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a CLI interface using Typer, so that I can easily manage and run the studio application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `uv run ais --help` THEN the system SHALL display available commands and options
2. WHEN a user runs `uv run ais run` THEN the system SHALL start the web-based FastUI interface with embedded Plotly components using `studio/main.py` as the single entry point
3. WHEN the web interface starts THEN the system SHALL provide a local server URL for browser access to the FastUI application
4. WHEN the user stops the application THEN the system SHALL gracefully shut down all services
5. WHEN the user runs `uv run ais` THEN the system SHALL display simple information about the application
6. WHEN the system is structured THEN the system SHALL use `studio/main.py` as the only main entry point and SHALL NOT create any other `main.py` files in any subdirectories or modules

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all UI objects and resources managed by FastUI, so that I can have a modern, reactive web interface with consistent component architecture.
